# Array-ADT

Create an array and implement the operations â€“ traverse(), insert_element(),delete_element(), sort(),search(), merge(), copy(), create(), isFull(),isEmpty()
and length(). Write a C program to demonstrate an arrayADT using defined operations appropriately using a menu-driven approach. Your programshould be able to 
print the array contents appropriately at any or all instances (as required may be). You must also ensure that no input is acquired within the body of functions,
nor (preferably) display any prompts/results.
